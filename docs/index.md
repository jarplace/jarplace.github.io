# Signing up

Before start using the app, you will need to sign up for some plan (yes, even for the free one). To do so, you can either manually go to https://jarp.lace, or you can execute `jarplace signup` - and this page will be automatically opened in your browser.

# Logging in

After creating an account you can log in to the application using `jarplace login`. Enter you email - the one you used for the signing up - and then enter authentication token that you'll recieve by email in a couple of seconds. That's it: you are in!

# Billing

`jarplace billing` lets you manage your subscriptions.

## list

Execute `jarplace billing list` to display all currently available plans (just like at the https://jarp.lace page).

## plan

`jarplace billing plan` will show you what plan are you using currently.

## change

`jarplace billing change PLAN_NAME` will change your current plan to the specified one, e.g.: `jarplace billing change pro`.
